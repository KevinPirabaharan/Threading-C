The main functionality of the dine program is to solve the dining philosophers problem.
The way this assignment works is it uses threads to carry out every action of the philosophers
(in this case eating or thinking) we use semaphores to lock and fork so that there is no chance
for a lock out. It takes in user input through command line arguments to tailor the progran to work
with specified values.

The holes program emulates memory allocation by taking in process and trying to allocate them to
a memory of 128 mbs. Using different methods to fit processes in. I used linked lists as a queue to
hold the processes. After that I store them in an array which represents the memory. Using first fit
I allocate the ram. And using linked lists commands, I can manipulate the queue to add processes
to the back when they are replaced in memory until the assignment is done.
